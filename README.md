# Child-Detection-Using-CNN
1.Data Collection: Gathering a dataset comprising images containing both children and adults.

2.Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the images to standardize size, orientation, and color. This step ensures consistency and improves the model's ability to learn relevant features.

3.Model Selection: Choosing a CNN architecture suitable for image classification tasks, considering factors such as depth, complexity, and computational efficiency.

4.Training: Training the CNN on the preprocessed dataset. During training, the model learns to classify images into two categories: children and adults, by adjusting its internal parameters based on the provided labels.

5.Validation: Validating the trained model on a separate dataset to evaluate its performance. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are typically used to measure effectiveness.

6.Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning the model and adjusting hyperparameters based on validation results to optimize performance.

7.Deployment: Deploying the trained CNN in real-world applications where it can automatically detect children in images.
